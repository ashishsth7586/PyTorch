    "### Objective\n",
    "The main objective of this project is to build a model that predicts the human activities such as Walking, Walking Upstairs, Walking Downstairs, Sitting, Standing or Laying.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Information\n",
    "The dataset is collected from 30 volunteers within an age group of 19-48 years wearing a smartphone on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz is captured. Further, the video was recorded to label the data manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sensors (accelerometer and gyroscope) signal were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlabping (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was seperated using a Butterworth Low-Pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequncy domain. <a href=\"https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones#\">[1]</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain jerk signals <strong>(tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ)</strong>.\n",
    "\n",
    "The magnitude of these 3-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidian norm. This magnitudes are represented as features with names: <strong>tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag and tBodyGyroJerkMag)</strong>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Frequency domain signals from some of the available signals are obtained applying a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). These signals objtained were labeled with prefix <strong>'f'</strong> as <strong> fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyGyroMag...</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "A video of the experiment including an example of the 6 recorded activities with one of the participants can be seen <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOEN9W05_4A\">here.</a>\n",
